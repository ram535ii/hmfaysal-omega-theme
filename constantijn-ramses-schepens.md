Building a bank @ [Monzo](https://monzo.com). I normally write about things I find interesting, though in theory that means you should be able to read about:
- tech leading
- more philosophical content
- some prose about building a bank on a distributed system
- posts about my thoughts on personal Saving and Investments
- Apache Kafka something or other

Though you can't read about any of this (yet), I clearly need to find more time to blog.
