Building a bank @ [Monzo](https://monzo.com). I normally write about things I find interesting, though in theory that means you should be able to read about:
- more philosophical content
- some prose about building a bank on a distributed system
- posts about my thoughts on personal Saving and Investments
- Apache Kafka something or other
Though you can't, I clearly need to find more time to blog.
