ðŸ‘‹ Pleased to meet you, I'm The Barefoot Tech Lead. My name is Constantijn, but in a professional context there seem to be more people that know I don't like to wear shoes than my name, so I'm running with it.

Right now you'll fine me building a bank @ [Monzo](https://monzo.com), tech leading (surprise, surprise). As this blog will demonstrate, my interests may stray far and wide, but at the end of the day I'm interested in what makes people tick, what can make us better at being us and how to run the most effective product squad I can. Technically speaking, I have a soft spot for Apache Kafka and distributed systems, with my hardware background peaking through the cracks every once in a while.
