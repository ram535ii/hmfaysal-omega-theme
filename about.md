ðŸ‘‹ Pleased to meet you, I'm The Barefoot Tech Lead. My name is Constantijn, but in a professional context there seem to be more people that know I don't like to wear shoes than my name, so I'm running with it.

Right now you'll fine me building a bank @ [Monzo](https://monzo.com), tech leading (surprise, surprise). As this blog will demonstrate, my interests may stray far and wide, but at the end of the day I'm interested in what makes people tick/effective, the art of building high quality systems (and as a result products) and how to run the most effective product squad I can. Technically speaking, I have a soft spot for Apache Kafka and distributed systems, with my hardware background peaking through the cracks every once in a while.

Feel free to reach out, <a href="mailto:constantijnschepens+barefoottechlead@gmail.com">email preferred</a>.
