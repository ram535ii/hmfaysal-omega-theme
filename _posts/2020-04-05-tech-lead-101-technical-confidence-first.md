This part six of a larger series, get started with the [introduction]({{site.url}}/technical/tech-lead-101-intro). Read the [table of contents]({{site.url}}/technical/tech-lead-101) to see all the posts so far.

The tension is quite literally in the name. Are you a technical authority? Or are you a leader? You can be either without the other, yet to be a tech lead you must excel at and be both. As a full time individual contributor you almost certainly have a natural strength. If it’s pure technical expertise it is often fairly obvious. Your strength is designing and implementing systems. If it’s tending towards leadership, it’s somewhat harder to identify without being in a leadership position. Your strength is probably glue work, naturally facilitating, caring about the people in your team and more. Remember, this doesn’t mean you can’t be strong at the other before you’re a tech lead, but I think it’s helpful to at least mentally place yourself on this spectrum. This is the first step, because it will help you pick and choose your next steps.

The big open question is, if you need to be good at both to be an effective tech lead, where do you start? In my mind the answer is the title of this post - technical confidence first. We’ll dive into more detail in a moment, but at a high level I say this because in my experience - once you become a tech lead for the first time you’ll have significantly more chances to upskill in leadership than in your technical competence. This competence is what fuels that technical confidence I refer to. This is especially true in the first months of being a tech lead, and rightfully so, because you’ve likely not been in this kind of leadership role before\*. So why confidence?

What I’m really saying is - be intentional about when you decide to accept the tech lead hat. You’re likely better off spending more time honing your technical skills over jumping into leadership too early. This isn’t a reason to postpone forever, you’ll never be fully ready, but this is one place I’d over index your focus. This technical expertise forms the foundation for the confidence you will fall back on when things get tough or stressful. The last thing you want is a team of people looking up to you, where you straight up don’t have the technical confidence to guide them forward.

I’m not implying you won’t have imposter syndrome or saying you need to be the most technically savvy in the room, or even that you need to be the decision maker. You absolutely don’t, but you need to believe in your own modal ability to solve problems and deal with ambiguity. Especially technical ambiguity. Inevitably you will have moments where you don’t feel confident and feel totally out of your depth, and that’s fine. This is exactly why you should intentionally move into this role knowing that technical confidence is something important, and worth investing in up front.

It may be cliche, but the circumstances in which a tech lead walks their first steps makes it true - it’s easier to learn leadership when you’ve got the tech than it is to learn the tech when you’ve got the leadership. Fortunately you have plenty of opportunities to build up your competence and confidence first.

The best way to build your confidence is time, a personal track record of solving technical problems you weren’t sure you could solve successfully. These are the things you will look back on in times of doubt to remind yourself you can do it (or others can help point them out too). Luckily amassing these examples is literally your job already.

So when in doubt, invest in “tech” before the “lead,” it will pay dividends from the get go.

PS: I chose the phrase “technical confidence” intentionally. It naturally implies a level of “technical competence,” because without that it would be “technical over-confidence.” In a similar vein, you can’t be competent in all the technologies your team will be using, so this isn’t a good target. For example, I’m no iOS engineer, but I have technical confidence grounded in a solid technical foundation, enabling me to have constructive conversations that both help iOS engineers in my team directly and inspires confidence. Watch out for a later post on helping engineers in a different discipline from your own.

\*Don’t confuse this with eventually building your confidence as a technical leader itself, which comes much later in the journey. Designing complex technical systems at a leader level of abstraction is a whole different technical competence out of scope for this post.
