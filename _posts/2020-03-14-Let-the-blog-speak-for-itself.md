Blogs always get written on, but never get to speak for themselves, so I'll let the blog do the talking for once. I mean at this rate it may even be the more prolific writer...

> Hi, thanks to Constantijn not making up his mind (and not blogging a lot), I've gone on quite the journey. I started out as "ramses.io", a blog about a electronics hardware engineer in self-denial on his journey to becoming a software engineer (whilst actually blogging more about philosophy). I mean he literally doesn't even own that domain anymore, what an amateur. Though the reference to his Egyptian middle name was pretty cool. Then I got a lazy rebrand to "constantijn.dev", just cause he thought it was an even cooler domain. I mean maybe it is, but then he literally didn't write any other blog posts - it's almost like building and maintaining the blog is sometimes more fun than the real hard work of writing quality (he wishes) content. Now that we're in for a second rebrand I've decided I need to speak out. Really hoping its more than just a day of fun and he actually takes it seriously (I think he agrees with me). Say it together "ðŸ¤ž fingers crossed for more regular content." I'll stop being petty now, he's actually got a backlog of posts he wants to write. So without further ado - welcome to The Barefoot Tech Lead!
