I have been in the same company for about nine months now. I mean that is enough time to have fathered a child - obviously in startup terms that means it's literally a lifetime worth of time. We are based out of a shared office space, with other companies within earshot all around. Before that I was trying to innovate in the mental health space with my own company, side by side with many other companies on an accelerator. What is key about almost every one of the companies I have spent the last 18 months around, since the day I graduated, is that they are all very early stage. Something I have watched or even tried to help many of these companies do for the first time is hiring. It is one of many 'firsts,' but one that is notoriously difficult. Experiencing this as an 'outsider,' never hiring for my own company this got me thinking about what I saw.

# The current paradigm
The number one thing I see people hiring for is talent. And on the surface this makes a ton of sense - especially if you are trying to hire more senior than yourself. From my perspective at the weathered age of 23, these are the only types of people I would be hiring. Nothing is more sought after in the job market than skills and experience. For mature companies this is emminently sensible, but this is where I get 'weird,' but I'm not sure in early stage startups it is. How can I even dare suggest this? Well firstly, maybe I'm totally wrong, but I'm not so sure.

Large, older companies or some might even dare, corporations, are by and large stable and money-making - otherwise they would no longer exist. When hiring from this position you can recruit what one might call 'premium quality clay', ready to be moulded into their role. As long as the quality of the original material was high, the resulting earthernware will also be high - since time is really not an issue. I have now already surfaced two things startups have little or none of, stability and time. You might say: "yes, but we have raised 3 million for our seed round." You would be right in saying that you have more stability and time than most, but still very little in the scheme of things - especially considering the product is still evolving week by week.

Why am I even bothering to say all this? I say this because I look at the given situation and think to myself: "Why not hire for perseverance?" That is what I want to suggest here.

# An alternate paradigm
Before going on, the first thing I want to clarify is this: Start ups need smart people, some of the greatest ideas become reality because great minds are brought together. I do no dispute this, I am merely considering an alternate reality where acumen is secondary in hiring to perseverance. Yes, there are countless outliers - hiring for a super deep tech product or something. I don't want to dedicate this 1000 odd word blog post to set conditions, so please be sensible. Any company will go through twist and turns, some more or less violent. If at this point you have some pristine earthenware (I am stretching this analogy so far...), it will break - a.k.a. leave. Instead you need need enough people around who will stick through thick and thin. So let me introduce my new hiring concept, illustrated through one of those escape the room, [exit games](https://youtu.be/O6_eHR0YAgo?t=54s).

The original, acumen-based, hiring paradigm would have been to lock candidates in the most intricate, complicated room and hire the one that gets out fastest. What my perseverance-based hiring paradigm suggests is locking your candidates in a room that has no solution at all and hire the one that gives up last. Some might mistake this as stupidity, but I would classify this as believing there is a solution out there - even to the most difficult problems. This is something that every single early stage start up needs.

Now, as I said, I have never actually hired someone - so I don't actually know what the hiring process for this would look like - so hit me up again in a few years!
