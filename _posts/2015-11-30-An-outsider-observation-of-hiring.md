I have been in the same company, Copyin, for over 12 months now. I mean that is enough time to have fathered a child - obviously in startup terms that is a mean lifespan. We are based out of a shared office space, with other companies within earshot all around. Before that I was trying to innovate in the mental health space with my own company, Tyto, again side by side with many other companies in an accelerator. Well a pre-seed investor program to be precise. What is key about almost every one of the companies I have spent the last 24 months around, since the day I graduated university, is that they are all very early stage. Something I have watched, or even tried to help, many of these companies do for the first time is hiring. It is one of many _firsts_, but one that is notoriously difficult. Experiencing this as an _outsider_, never hiring for my own company this got me thinking about what I saw.

# The current paradigm
The number one thing I see people hiring for is talent. They want to hire the **best** person. On the surface this makes a ton of sense - especially if you are trying to hire more senior than yourself. From my perspective at the weathered age of 24, these are the only types of people I would be hiring. Nothing is more sought after in the job market than skill and experience. For mature companies this is eminently sensible, but I'm not sure in early stage startups it is. “Hold the phone, did he just suggest we should be hiring for something other than skills and experience?!” Yes!

Large, older companies are by and large stable and money-making - otherwise they would, or should, no longer exist. When hiring from this position you can recruit what one might call (queue rustic analogy) _premium quality clay_. This is talent ready to be moulded into a specific role. As long as the quality of the original talent was high, the resulting employee will fulfil their role well. So to stick with our analogy, you gona get some fine porcelain - since time is really not an issue. I have now already surfaced two things startups have little or none of, stability and time. You might say: "yes, but we have raised 3 million for our seed round." You would be right in saying that you have more stability and time than most, but still very little in the scheme of things - especially considering your product is still evolving week by week, if not day by day.

Why am I even bothering to say all this? I say this because I look at the given situation and think to myself: "Why not hire for perseverance?" That is what I want to suggest here.

# An alternate paradigm
Before going on, the first thing I want to clarify is this: Start ups need smart people, some of the greatest ideas become reality because great minds are brought together. I do no dispute this, I am merely considering an alternate reality where acumen is secondary to perseverance. Yes, there are countless outliers - hiring for a super deep tech product or something. I don't want to dedicate this 1000 odd word blog post to set conditions, so be sensible.

Any company will go through twist and turns, some more or less violent. If at this point you have a pristine porcelain vase (I am stretching this analogy so far...), it will shatter - a.k.a. a leaving team member. Instead you need enough people around who will stick through thick and thin, a good ‘ol clay pot that can take a beating. It’s less relevant if it was `top quality` material, as long as it’s tough as shit. So let me introduce my new hiring concept, illustrated through one of those escape the room, [exit games](https://youtu.be/O6_eHR0YAgo?t=54s).

The original, acumen-based, hiring paradigm would have been to lock candidates in the most intricate, complicated room and hire the one that gets out fastest. What my perseverance-based hiring paradigm suggests is locking your candidates in a room that has no solution at all and hire the one that gives up last. Some might mistake this as stupidity, but I would classify this as believing there is a solution out there, even in the face of the impossible. Well some candidates will be straight up lacking, but lets assume we can filter those out. You probably shouldn’t be trying to build a billion dollar company from the ground up if you didn’t believe you could accomplish the impossible in some respect. This is something that every single early stage start up needs. This can be awesomely summarized as needing people who don't even consider failure as an option, to them it does not exist.

I have only ever heard this mentality associated with founders, but I think the same is true for the entire founding team - founders won't get far without them. What the difference is between the two is a blog post for another time (clue: I don’t have the answer).

Now, as I said, I have never actually hired someone, so I don't actually know what the hiring process for this would look like. Hit me up again in a few years! I most definitely intend to try it. At the same time, I challenge anyone reading this to give it a shot - the earlier the stage the employee the better.




Oh and culture fit, that stuffs pretty important…..
